Hero Roller!

This is my stackathon project that I build over three days. The goal of the stackathon was to build something of personal interest utilizing new technology. To challenge myself, I used react-native to build my first mobile app. 

Hero Roller is a mobile dice rolliing app for fans of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons & Dragons. You can use roll any of the common dice in TTRPG from a four sided dice to even a one hundred sided dice (rolling two ten sided dice in real life).
