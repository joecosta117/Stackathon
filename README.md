Hero Roller!

This is my stackathon project that I build over three days. The goal of the stackathon was to build something of personal interest utilizing new technology. To challenge myself, I used react-native to build my first mobile app. 

Hero Roller is a mobile dice rolliing app for fans of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons & Dragons. You can use roll any of the common dice in TTRPG from a four sided dice to even a one hundred sided dice (rolling two ten sided dice in real life).

Tired of rolling 8d6 every time you cast a "fireball"? If you are a player in a Dungeons & Dragons game, you can add your character to your list of heroes and add the dice for fireball under your character. 


Add Hero or Dice Set

Add a Hero form (if you don't enter a hero name, the form gets mad!)

A specific hero (Xarro the wizard) after rolling for "fireball"

Since Hero Roller was built over 3 days, the functionality is rudimentary. If I had more time, I would add a number of features, such as:
sign up and login for users, improve the styling, remove characters and dice sets as a logged in user, create a screen view for miscellaneous dice sets that aren't tied to a specific hero, and create a history page to show your most recent dice rolls
