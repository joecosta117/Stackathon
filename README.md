# Hero Roller!

[Watch my Presentation](https://youtu.be/eZB39pdRWU8)

Hero Roller is a mobile dice rolliing app for fans of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons & Dragons. You can use roll any of the common dice in TTRPG from a four sided dice to even a one hundred sided dice (rolling two ten sided dice in real life). Hero Roller was my project for a three day stackathon. 

### Features Included:

- Roll any standard dice used in TTRPGs such as 1d4 or 1d20
- Select a hero and roll one of their sets of dice ("fireball!")
- Add a new hero to your list of heroes
- Add a new dice set for a hero
